### Components

**Avatar:**
- Added a slot to let users replace the Avatarâ€™s content.

**Button:**
- Introduced a ripple effect on click for clearer interaction feedback.

**Card:**
- Removed default minimum height and width to allow more flexible sizing.

**Checkbox:**
- Restored label click behavior, so users can check/uncheck via the label.

**Dropdown:**
- Added a `toggle` method to manually control the open state when using a custom trigger slot.
  (Previously handled internally by Headless UI, now exposed for users after removing that dependency.)

**Input:**
- Standardized padding and spacing across all sizes and variants.
- Fixed icon misalignment when `type="number"`.

**Navbar:**
- Fixed border-radius not being applied correctly when using different `shape` values (`rounded`, `square`, `soft`) with `floating`.

**Notification:**
- Restored the `text` prop in the TypeScript interface (previously removed by mistake).

### Tests

- Updated test suites for `Input`, `Select`, and `Card` to reflect recent changes.

### Docs

- Added `css` language support.

**Pages:**
- Updated Dropdown docs with an example using the new `toggle` method and custom trigger content.
- Updated Icon API docs to include ARIA props.
