### Components

**Avatar:**
- Added a slot to let users replace the Avatarâ€™s content.

**Button:**
- Introduced a ripple effect on click for clearer interaction feedback.
- Added `type` prop for better form compatibility. (`button`, `reset`, `submit`.)
- Fixed `condensed` prop not working correctly.

**Card:**
- Removed default minimum height and width to allow more flexible sizing.

**Checkbox:**
- Restored label click behavior, so users can check/uncheck via the label.

**Dropdown:**
- Added a `toggle` method to manually control the open state when using a custom trigger slot.
  (Previously handled internally by Headless UI, now exposed for users after removing that dependency.)

**Input:**
- Standardized padding and spacing across all sizes and variants.
- Fixed icon misalignment when `type="number"`.
- Added `blur` event emit.

**Navbar:**
- Fixed border-radius not being applied correctly when using different `shape` values (`rounded`, `square`, `soft`) with `floating`.

**Notification:**
- Restored the `text` prop in the TypeScript interface (previously removed by mistake).

**Popover:**
- Replaced `w-fit/h-fit` with `w-auto/h-auto` to allow popover sizing based on content.

**Tabs:**
- Added slots for tab customization. Slot names are now `item['key']-tab` and `item['key']-content`.
- Fixed `grow` prop not working correctly.

**Textarea:**
- Standardized padding and spacing across all sizes and variants.
